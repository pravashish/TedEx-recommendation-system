# TED Talk Recommendation System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a basic recommendation system for TED Talks. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of TED Talks and suggest similar talks based on a given input.

## Key Features

* **Data Exploration:** The notebook explores a dataset of TED Talks, including data cleaning and visualization.
* **Text Preprocessing:** Text data (talk titles and descriptions) is preprocessed using techniques like stop word removal.
* **Similarity Calculation:** TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to vectorize text, and cosine similarity and Pearson correlation are used to measure similarity between talks.
* **Recommendation Generation:** The system takes an input query or talk description and recommends similar TED Talks.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, etc.).
3.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook.
4.  Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the data and generate TED Talk recommendations.
